# FireDataJava
Final Project for Data Structures course. Utilize Java GUI to read in past fire data and use mathematical location formula to test the relativity of a location to a fire. 


All images and csv are imported to the IntelliJ Project. We have included a data folder. Download each file -> copy -> click on the name of your IntelliJ Project and paste the file. 
Necessary for each png/jpeg and the csv. This should allow the code to work on your personal machine as well!
